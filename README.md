# üá∞üáø Awesome Made in Kazakhstan [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of open source projects that were made and extensively contributed to by developers from Kazakshtan üá∞üáø.

## Motivation

Open source software is a multicultural product. When you install/use a piece of software, you rarely think of a person who created it. Nevertheless, each creator has its national and cultural context. Our goal is to highlight the Ukrainian part of your `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Gemfile`, etc.

Moreover, lots of developers from Kazakhstan don't even know about their fellow citizens creating popular projects. It makes you proud when you undestand how much Ukrainians contribute to global software culture.

A lot of developers in Kazakshtan do not know about these projects and the fact that their authors are also programmers from Kazakhstan. It warms your heart when you understand that a lot of highly popular and useful projects are made by our fellow countrymen.

## Contributing 

This list includes projects under this criteria:

1. The project has over 100 stars
2. The project's creator or maintainer was born in Kazakhstan
3. The project creator or maintainer self-identify themselves as Kazakh/Kazakhstani

If these conditions are met, feel free to open a PR.

Feel free to add new section if the appropriate one doesn't exist yet.

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars as a measurement. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have here on Github.


If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
